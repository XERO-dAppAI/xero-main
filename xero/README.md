# Xero - AI-Powered Food Waste Management System


## 🌱 Vision & Impact

Xero revolutionizes food waste management by combining artificial intelligence and blockchain technology on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). Our platform helps businesses reduce food waste by up to 40%, potentially saving millions of tons of food annually while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.



## 🎯 Core Problems We Solve

1. **Food Waste Crisis**

   - 1.3 billion tons of food wasted annually

   - $1 trillion economic loss globally

   - 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions



2. **Inventory Inefficiencies**

   - Poor expiration date tracking

   - Inefficient stock rotation

   - Manual inventory management

   - Reactive rather than proactive approach



3. **Distribution Challenges**

   - Disconnect between surplus food and need

   - Limited redistribution networks

   - Time-sensitive logistics



## 🚀 Solution Architecture



### 1. Smart Canister System

Our system utilizes four main canisters on the Internet Computer:



#### Inventory Canister

```rust

type ItemStatus = variant {

    Active;

    ExpiringSoon;

    Expired;

    LowStock;

    OutOfStock;

};



type InventoryItem = record {

    item_id: text;

    barcode: text;

    name: text;

    expiration_date: nat64;

    quantity: nat32;

    price: float64;

    status: ItemStatus;

    audit_trail: vec AuditLog;

};

```
